Ar2 ground state
  Method:    CCSD(T)
  Basis set: aug-cc-pV6Z an additional set of diffuse basis
            functions was added at the midpoint position between the two atoms
            the exponents of the latter functions were taken to be the most diffuse
            s, p, d, f, and g exponents from the aug-cc-pV6Z basis set
  Reference: JCP 141, 064307 (2014)

Ar+(3p-1) - Ar+(3p-1) states
  Method:    CISD
  Basis set: cc-pVDZ augmented with two diffuse s functions,
            two diffuse d functions and two compact d functions
  Reference: JCP 141, 064307 (2014)

ArAr+*(3p-2 nl) states
  Method:    CISD
  Basis set:
  
  
ArAr+(3s-1) state
  Method:    nD-ADC(3)
  Basis set: cc-pVTZ augmented with a set of 3s, 3p, and 3d functions of the KBJ-type
  Reference: JCP 146, 104305 (2017)
  NIST: shifted to the NIST value of 29.2393635 eV (Ar+ 3s 13.47945... + Ar+ 3p 15.759...) at 30 Angstroms

Ar+Ar* (3p-1 4s) and Ar+Ar*(3p-1 4p) states (Sigma_g+ and Sigma_u+ only)
  MethodL     nD-ADC(3)
  Basis set:  cc-pVTZ augmented with a set of 3s, 3p, and 3d functions of the KBJ-type
  Reference: JCP 146, 104305 (2017)
